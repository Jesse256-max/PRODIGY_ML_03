# 🐱🐶 Cats vs. Dogs Classifier (SVM)
A simple image classifier using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to distinguish between cats and dogs using grayscale, resized images from the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset.

# 📁 Dataset
Download from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data
Unzip the dataset and set the path to the train/ folder in the script.

# 🧠 What It Does
Loads a small number of cat and dog images
Converts them to grayscale
Resizes them to 64×64
Flattens and feeds them into a linear SVM
Prints accuracy on a test split

# 🚀 How to Run
# Set the correct dataset path in svm_classifier.py:
DATADIR = "path_to_dataset/train"

# Run the script:
python svm_classifier.py
